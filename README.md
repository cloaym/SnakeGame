# SnakeGame
Play at https://cloaym.github.io/SnakeGame/

This project was my first foray into web development! I came to software engineering in a roundabout way (my background was in medical image processing). Because my job was working on a Java desktop application, I wanted to fill in the gaps left without a structured CS education. So this was a hands-on way to practice some fundamental skills in my industry since I didn't need them at my job.

My goals for this project were to learn
- the (very) basics of how websites work
- Git (I used Mercurial at work)
- GitHub
- basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming
- a simple, plug-and-play way to deploy a static website

My goals for this project were not
- to create a perfect, bug-free, professional-quality website
- to write code that others could easily understand, maintain, and extend (that's hard, and I get plenty of practice with it at my job!)

I wanted to make a snake game because it was
- familiar (I wanted to spend my time learning web dev, not doing background research)
- lighthearted (if I was going to spend my free time on it, it should be fun!), and
- extensible (it was easy to set small goals for the project, then add to it over time without needing to refactor anything).

Although most commits are under my name, I pair-programmed this with my friend and coworker, [Sarah Whelan](https://github.com/SWhelan), with weekly video calls over a few months. Any mistakes or code-smells, of course, are solely mine :P
